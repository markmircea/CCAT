                            <p><strong>Explanation: </strong>The pattern should be an upside-down triangle followed by a triangle. So, the question mark should be replaced by an upside-down triangle.</p>

                            <p>CCAT verbal test typically contains <strong>17 questions</strong>, challenging candidates to <strong>identify a word's correct meaning, recognize relationships between words, and select appropriate words in specific contexts.</strong></p>

                            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> ESTEEMED is to SEEDY</p>
                            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The relationship between DELUSIONAL (not based in reality) and GROUNDED (based in reality) is antonym because the two words have opposite meanings. So we need to find a pair of words that also has opposite meanings, and that is ESTEEMED (respected and admired) is to SEEDY (bad and terrible).</p>

                            <h2 id="faqs" class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">FAQs</h2>
                            <p><strong>1. How are CCAT assessments scored?</strong></p>
                            <p>In CCATs, each correct answer gets you one point. When the test is completed, your employers will receive your raw score – the number of questions you answer correctly (x/50) and your percentile – how your results compared with those who take the test (eg: 70%). If you score 70%, your result is better than 70% of people who have done the test.</p>

                            <p><strong>2. How can I answer all 50 questions in the CCAT assessment?</strong></p>
                            <LazyImage src="/storage/img/1669372162795_ccat_assessments8_1500_x938.png" class="content-image" />

                            <p>15 minutes for 50 questions mean that you have less than 20 seconds to answer a question. Pretty challenging, huh? However, don't you worry too much.</p>
                            <p>According to Criteria Corp, <strong>less than 1% of test takers</strong> answer all 50 questions and candidates get 24 questions right on average.</p>

                            <p>It's worth noting that CCAT assessments have no penalty for wrong answers. As under heavy time constraints, you're better off spending 30s for one question. If you cannot solve one, just make a guess and move on.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, Criteria Corp does suggest raw score ranges based on specific positions such as Analyst, Administrative Assistant, Computer Programmer, Accounting/ Finance, etc. Find more information below.</p>

                            <p><strong>3. Are CCAT and UCAT the same?</strong></p>
                            <p>The UCAT (Universal Cognitive Aptitude Test) is a shortened version of the CCAT assessment, which is also provided by Criteria Corp. It covers math and logic, spatial/ abstract reasoning, not including verbal.</p>
