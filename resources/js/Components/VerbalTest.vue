      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>Answer:</strong> ESTEEMED is to SEEDY</p>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-300">
        <strong>Explanation:</strong> The relationship between DELUSIONAL (not based in reality) and GROUNDED (based in reality) is antonym because the two words have opposite meanings. So we need to find a pair of words that also has opposite meanings, and that is ESTEEMED (respected and admired) is to SEEDY (bad and terrible).
